## A conversation with Ben
I only know the German version.
Therefore, my translation may be inaccurate.

Jeremias (driving an old car he found
and painted red with a yellow roof):
> If you ask me, be satisfied with this thing.
> That boss and his people are very dangerous.
> I know what I'm talking about. You know, when
> I was young and spry, I was the boss of a
> great big gang myself.

Ben:
> Come on, half of that.

Jeremias:
> Well, I was the boss' right hand.

Ben:
> I said half of that.

Jeremias:
> Since you're making a fuss: I was the youngest chef in the
> old man's restaurant.

Ben:
> Now we're getting close.

Jeremias:
> How did you know all that?

Ben (laughing):
> You already told me 999 times!
